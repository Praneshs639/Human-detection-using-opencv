#windows user: intsall each pip file in "VS Code"-terminal one by one.

pip uninstall opencv-python-headless - #if opencv is installed in your system use this to delete the older opencv
pip install opencv-python - #Install the full version of OpenCV
pip install opencv-contrib-python - #Optionally, install additional OpenCV modules
pip install --upgrade opencv-python - #upgrade opencv

#Linux Users: Install GTK or QT Libraries

#On Linux systems, OpenCV may need additional libraries to support GUI functionality

#Install the required dependencies:
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6 -y
#above two code is to install after installation of gkt or qt libraries in linux using "linux terminal".


#for both 'linux' and 'windows' pip code is common and need to install each pip code in "VS Code"-terminal one by one.
